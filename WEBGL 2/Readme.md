This program establishes a connection between Unity 2021.3.13 and javascipt utilizing the WEBGL framework.  This example
includes two buttons in the index.html file from building the project, to change the color of a circle in unity.
The modifications made to this project are in the javasciptHook.cs file and the index.html file that was generated by building the program.
The only other changes made to the default project generated by unity are the circle and empty gameobject javascriptHook which is the link between the javasciptHook.cs file and the circle sprite renderer.
Note: In order to get Webgl to build in Unity you have to disable compression in the build settings, otherwise the engine will not load.  
build settings -> player settings -> player -> publishing settings -> compression format -> disabled (default is brotli change this to disabled)

The index.html file is found in WEBGL 2 -> build -> index.html. You will need to rebuild the program and replace the generated index.html file with the one provided in this repository.
